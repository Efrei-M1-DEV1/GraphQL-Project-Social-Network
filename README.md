# Social Network Platform

This is a social network web application where users can register, post articles, comment on others' posts, and like articles. Itâ€™s built using modern technologies like React, GraphQL, and Prisma, and is currently under active development.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**:  
    - Fully implemented with JWT-based login and registration.
    - Password hashing with `bcrypt` and input validation using `zod`.
- **Article Posting and Management**:  
    - Queries (`articles`, `article(id)`, `articlesByAuthor`) implemented with pagination.
    - Mutations (create, update, delete) in progress, pending merge.
- **Commenting on Articles**:  
    - Planned, not yet implemented.
- **Liking Articles**:  
    - Planned, not yet implemented.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Redux Toolkit, Apollo Client, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Vite
- **Backend**: Apollo Server, Prisma (with SQLite), GraphQL Codegen
- **Monorepo Management**: Turborepo with pnpm workspaces
- **Validation**: Zod for type-safe input validation
- **Utilities**: Shared in `packages/utils` (ES Modules)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Efrei-M1-DEV1/GraphQL-Project-Social-Network.git
    cd GraphQL-Project-Social-Network
    ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
    - Install dependencies for the entire monorepo (covers `apps/*` and `packages/*`):
        ```bash
        pnpm install
        ```
    > ***Note:** This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager, as specified in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.*
    
3. **Set up the database:**
    - Create a `.env` file in `apps/server/` with:
        ```bash
        echo "DATABASE_URL=file:./prisma/dev.db" > apps/server/.env
        echo "JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" >> apps/server/.env
        ```
    - Run Prisma migrations to initialize the SQLite database:
        ```bash
        cd apps/server
        pnpm prisma migrate dev --name init
        ```
4. **Start the servers:**
    - **Backend (Apollo Server):**
        ```bash
        cd apps/server
        pnpm dev
        ```
      - Runs on `http://localhost:4000` by default.
    - **Frontend (React with Vite):**
        ```bash
        cd apps/web
        pnpm dev
        ```
      - Runs on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Usage

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to access the frontend. (UI in progress).
- Visit `http://localhost:4000` to explore the GraphQL Playground and test queries.
- Core features commenting, and liking are still in development.
